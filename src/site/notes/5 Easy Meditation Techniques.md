![](https://images.hive.blog/0x0/https://tapn2wellness.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/book-cover.jpg?w=150&h=150&crop=1)

One question I get on the regular is “how do I meditate?”. Truth told, there is no right or wrong way. No activity is more personal than meditation so you shouldn’t stress yourself trying to emulate someone else’s path. However, we should always look to history to gain insight for what we are trying to accomplish today. Keep in mind that meditation has been practiced on every land mass that covers our earth for millennia. It is literally older than religion itself so you can imagine how many different meditation methods have been practiced over time. After years of study, self-observation and interaction with other [[Vault/Wellness/Wellness\|Wellness]] practitioners I have singled out 5 techniques that have proven to be easy to understand and very beneficial to those who commit to them. I suggest committing at least 10 minutes a day (more if you can) to your practice and using a timer. So find your comfort zone, whether just sitting in a chair or a traditional meditation posture and let’s get started. And remember to keep that spine erect! 

**1. Deep Breath Meditation**

When introducing people to meditation I like to suggest they start off with deep breath meditation because deep breaths are important in any meditation practice. This also tends to be a good starting point because most sources will suggest that in order to meditate all you need to do is focus on the breath. This is indeed a good approach but for some it leaves too much room for self-interpretation. Here are a few more direct ways of practicing deep breath meditation:

- Focus on the sensation of the breath flowing inward and outward. Visualize the stream of breath as it leaves your body and as it enters.
- Take 6 second inhales and 5 second exhales.  +/- a second if needed. 
- Gently push out your stomach during inhales and pull in during exhales.

**2. Guided Meditation**

Guided meditations are also great for beginners because it provides the user with an object, sound, or place to focus their attention on. This greatly assists with quieting the “mind’s chatter”. A few common guided meditation methods are:

- Meditation music or [solfeggio tones](https://attunedvibrations.com/solfeggio/)
- Staring at the flame of a candle (it works, trust me)
- Nature’s soundtrack (if outdoors) 

**3. Aum/Om Meditation**

Throughout many ancient scriptures and traditions _Aum(Om)_ is considered to be the "first sound" or "mother of all sound". In many disciplines and religions it is a starting point for beginning a meditation practice. The powerful chanting of _Aum_ creates a vibration that travels from the brain all the way through the spinal column. If you are at all familiar with the chakra system you know that this pathway is where the energy centers in the body are located.

**4. Body Scan Meditation**

A form of guided meditation, body scan meditation also helps us to raise our inner awareness. By starting at your toes and slowly moving up the body during inhalations we become more conscious of all the subtle and pronounced sensations that occur within. As you move up the body be sure to place more focus on your vital organs (liver, heart, brain, etc.).

**5. Mantra/Positive Affirmation Meditation**

Repeating positive words/expression over and over has a way of providing us with some serenity. By reciting mantras or creating our own positive affirmations we can bring specific energies to life. Mantras are sacred chants that derive from Sanskrit. Many of the more powerful [mantras](http://fractalenlightenment.com/37167/spirituality/4-powerful-mantras-for-peace-happiness-guidance) have been found carved in stone and are thousands of years old. So choose a mantra or create a positive affirmation and get started.For a more extensive explanation of meditation culture, misconceptions and techniques check out my [e-book on meditation for beginners](https://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Buddha-30-Days-Meditating-ebook/dp/B0104RHEDE).
