### We Are Astrology & The Zodiac

Current traditions and a lack of admiration for the cosmos make it easy for us to fall into the trap of viewing the heavenly law (as coined by nobleanpu) of [[astrology\|astrology]] as a belief system - just a set of characteristics and predictions to be accepted or dismissed. But this limited perspective causes us to miss one of the deepest truths...astrology isn't something to believe in, it is the language of astral communication that is inherent within us. You can learn the language, or not. It is something we fundamentally are.

This is not to be confused with "fortune-telling" or "predicting the future". These are profit-seeking activities, not God-seeking ones and are for the most part responsible for the bad rap that has been placed on astrology in recent generations.

> The human body has been called the microcosm of the universe, a little world of wonders and a monument of divine wisdom and power, sufficient to convince the most incredulous mind of the existence of the Great Designer.

-A.B. Simpson

There is plenty of science to support this concept. For instance, the elements that primarily compose our physical form - oxygen, carbon, nitrogen - were birthed in stellar explosions millions of light-years away. We are literally made of stardust 💫. The is why the universe speaks through us, not as a cryptic language to be deciphered, but as the very DNA of our being. We are not just observers in the unfolding of the cosmos, we are active creators and participants.

### The Human Body & The Solar System

The parallels between the human body and our solar system are something to be in awe of when you start connecting the dots. Consider the following correlations:

- Circadian rhythms synchronize with Earth's 24-hour rotation
- Lunar cycles impact human sleep and emotional patterns
- Lunar cycles effect the tides globally (not directly related to the human body...until you consider the obvious fact that we are primarily composed of water)
- Solar activity has measurable effects on human physiological and psychological states

Mere coincidence, or evidence of our fundamental connection to the heavenly bodies?

After any unbiased consideration we should all at least be able to agree that, based on our body composition alone, the Sun and the Moon have some direct influence over our human experience, internally and externally.

> Our body is a masterpiece of the cosmos. Our body carries within it the stars, the moon, the universe, and the presence of all our ancestors.

-Thich Nhat Hanh

Next we must address the zodiacs. I would describe the zodiac signs as archetypes that represent different human modes of experience. They are not predetermined destinies, but landscapes that reflect our multifaceted nature.

We previously determined that the sun and the moon have influence over us. If this is a fact, we should also be able to agree that the other planetary bodies within the same solar SYSTEM have to have some level of influence, however minor or significant that may be. Astrology states that the "type" of influence a specific planetary body has on Earth is identifiable. These influences fluctuate based on a particular planets position, composition, magnetism, etc.

Two more things we must consider when discussing the zodiac and its archetypes:

1. These influences or "energies" existed before language. Part of the issue is we recognize the words associated with each planet as the energy itself, instead of an unfolding or manifestation of the energy.
2. There are 2 sides to every coin. Every manifestation has a flip side to it.

Example, there are 4 fundamental energies that make up our reality: fire, air, earth, water. Everything can built on top of, or extracted from these 4 blocks of existence. These 4 elements are also used to classify different zodiac signs. Let's look at the fire signs of Aries, Sagittarius, and Leo (wink wink). The words associated with fire signs are typically confident, independent, passionate, energetic, short-tempered, impatient.

Now we can see that the primordial energy is fire, but it can manifest in a number of different ways while still staying true to its form. It can manifest as the fuel to push you towards yours wildest dreams, or the battery in your back that made you commit a crime of passion.

This is a science and one of the many languages of the most high, not a belief system.

We are not separate from the cosmos. We are the cosmos experiencing itself through human consciousness. Each of us carries within us the entire history of the universe.

> The cosmos is within us. We are made of star-stuff. We are a way for the universe to know itself

-Carl Sagan
