"Want to be better? Set some goals."

This is the one-size-fit-all advice we've all heard our entire lives when we have the intent of attaining or changing something in our lives. But why does it seem so hard to actually get across that finish line? An even better question, why is the gap between intention and reality so wide? We focus on the outcome, the big win, the final result. But somewhere between the intention and the reality, things fall apart.

We lose momentum, get discouraged, or simply never even start.

The truth is, we are unknowingly trying to skip steps in the manifestation process. Too much focus on the "have" - the possessions, the accolades, the destination. Not enough considering the journey or, more importantly, who we need to be to get there. Far too often, we make the mistake of trying to jump straight to "have."

This brings me to a core manifestation principle that one of my favorite online business coaches, Myron Golden preaches: **Be, Do, Have**.

- **Be**: This is about your identity, your mindset, the fundamental qualities of the person who has already achieved what you desire.
- **Do**: These are the actions, the habits, the consistent behaviors that pave the road to your goal.
- **Have**: This is the end result, your initial goal actualized.

Here's how "Uncle Myron" sums it up:

The simplicity of this is genius. He's goes deeper on the concept in some of his YouTube videos, but there are many ways to peel back this onion yourself for more insight.

One thing I realized from my own experience is that we've got the process backwards in our minds. Think about it, this is our normal prioritization when creating goals:

1. The "Have" (Goal)
2. The "Do" (Actions)
3. The "Be" (Identity)

This speaks volumes to focusing on the journey and not the destination.

### How To BE

We say "I want financial freedom (have), so I will _do_ these activities. Then I will _be_ this type of person." The goal is always front and center, followed by checklists of things to "do". The emphasis on "being" is missing. This is the big problem. We treat the end result like its the seed, when that is the role of the identity.

What is it about the "be" aspect that causes it to get overlooked? Once I realized that "Being" is more of an inactive (yin -) principle, while "Doing" is obviously active (yang +), things became clearer. This brings me to the fact that its harder to give up old habits (stop doing) than it is to start new ones. Old habits are engrained in our psyche and require extra effort to part ways with. This is why we want to jump right into the "to-dos" that will get us closer to our goal without giving up our old ways. If your old ways aren't in alignment with your desired results, what you "do" will be far less effective. First key in on "addition by subtraction." What you say "no" to will have a greater impact than what you say "yes" to.

For example, my gym efforts will be far less effective if I'm unwilling to give up certain foods and stop staying up late. So, what I'm not willing to give up places added resistance on my path to achieving my desired results. Its also important to directly replace the activities you're removing. Instead of just giving up certain foods, actively replace those with healthy foods.

I personally had a bad habit of eating vending machine snacks only while at work. I countered this by making a grocery list specifically with the foods I'm replacing the vending machine snacks with. In this case it was foods like fresh & dried fruits, nuts, seeds, etc.

### Actively BEING The Future YOU

To even further reinforce the "Being" aspect of manifestation, we must create a clear, definite vision of what our desired future self looks like.

What does a day look like for you when you're in complete control of your time and finances? What have you given up that no longer serves you? In your new position of power, what do you consume on a daily basis, both physically and mentally? What do you stay away from? Where are you?

Remember Abdullah's famous reply to Nevill Goddard's worry about reaching his destination,

> You are (already) in Barbados.

Answering these questions will further intensify your vision and feeling of "Being", making it easier to materialize the future you. Now that you know the importance of being, you can move on to the specific actions you need to take (Do) to merge the yin with the yang.
