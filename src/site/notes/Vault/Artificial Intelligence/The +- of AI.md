We are headed (or already in) for a technological paradigm where [[Vault/Artificial Intelligence/Artificial Intelligence\|Artificial Intelligence]] will be sewn into every fabric of our personal and business lives. This realization has put many in a position where they feel they have to label the technology "positive" or "negative". We must recognize that this technology is not inherently good or bad, much like any tool. Fire can be used to illuminate, or to burn sh!t to the ground. With that in mind, AI's overall impact will be shaped by the intent and actions of those who develop and utilize it.

With the power to improve healthcare, revolutionize education, and solve complex global challenges, it also poses a bunch of risks. There are huge concern about ethics, job displacement, privacy concerns, and humans just becoming lazy among many other things.

This contrast that we see present in AI reflects the diverse aspirations (+) and fears (-) of our species, shining light on the duality that is present in everything in our existence. This highlights the need for mindful development practices and responsible use. Let's explore the importance of balanced perspectives in shaping its future.

It all comes down to choice. One aspect or manifestation of duality is the option to choose 2 paths/outcomes. It is within everyone's power, individually and collectively, to choose that path and then walk it. If you want artificial intelligence to have a positive impact on your life, you must contribute to, support, and perpetuate the overall good. And you don't have to be tech-savvy. This can be done with your dollars, attention, network, data, etc.

A prime example of contributing to the overall good is the InLEO platform. Here we have innovative, dedicated developers and community members that are embracing AI and implementing it. Because of that, InLEO serves as a medium where the future of AI can be discussed...or orchestrated. The LEOAI launch will only further these discussions.

The advent of AI obviously comes with its opportunities and challenges. What isn't so obvious is the part that each of us plays in where we go from here. As we enter this paradigm shift, it’s up to YOU to determine our future relationship with artificial intelligence.
