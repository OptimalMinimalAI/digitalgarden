As of today, 1/31/2026, I am at a crossroad. Making the transition from a 40+ hour/week overnight warehouse job to a full-time tech bro. Daily prayer and a conscious effort to get closer to Allah has granted me a new found clarity and peace in what many would consider moments of uncertainty. My theme for 2026 is to see the God in every scenario, every endeavor, every moment. 

When the Most High is top of mind, grace and favor will play a hand in all your endeavors.

### Brand Projects
The big brand projects I have on my plate for the 1st quarter of 2026 are:

(1) 1|ME OS - a foundational framework for solo founders and small teams that consists of 3 core components: a personal assessment, 7 cognitive disciplines system, and a digital HQ structure that simplifies operations and jump-starts AI implementation. This is the operating system I created to free myself. 
The system is in tact, it just needs to packaged right for the public.

(2)  Prompt Architect - a simple, user-friendly web app that allows users to go from idea to product in minutes.

(3) A new home page for Versed Solutions Unltd that highlights my portfolio and high-ticket design services.

### Love Projects
My current love projects are:

(1) The Golden Heart Hub App

(2) Creating income streams for the Golden Heart Hub

(3) A video presentation highlighting historic women in Islam

(4) A digital photo album collecting all family photos, past and present.
