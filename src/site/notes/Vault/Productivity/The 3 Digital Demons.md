###### The digital age we're in today is filled with boundless opportunity. All the knowledge and education we could ever want is literally at our fingertips.

###### The internet and information age has created a no-excuse environment when it comes to pursuing your passions and being productive. This recent tweet from Bitcoin maxi A. Pompliano summed it up pretty well:

As great as these advancements in tech are, especially when it comes to the exchanging of value & information, we have to be aware of the possible consequences. This brings us to the title of this post, "The 3 Digital Demons".

I want to shine light on how what some call "digital dependence" can really be a detriment to your happiness, health, and productivity. The "conveniences" we love so much that come from our digital devices can also come with a great cost if we aren't conscious of our habits.

Now when I use the term "demons" I'm primarily referring to energies more than the spiritual entities that are associated with the term. These 3 energies will become more or less prevalent in our lives based on how we handle the responsibility of having this unlimited digital access.

This applies more than ever to us in the crypto space. If I don't make a conscious effort to schedule real time away from my laptop I end up looking at it for most of my waking hours of the day.

Taming these demons are a prerequisite to success and happiness in today's world. These "energies" promote busyness over productivity and keep you out of your flow state. Even though they can overlap in some instances its important to recognize them each as their own animal, or demon.

###### **1) Digital Overload**

Digital Overload is the result of being constantly connected to digital platforms, their content and their notifications. It creates a feeling of "too much to learn, too much information, too little time".

I have been experiencing this to a degree since I decided to take some coding courses a few weeks back. Keeping up with the fast moving crypto market is hard enough, but since I've added coding in the mix it can get overwhelming at times.

Logging in to all these platforms on a daily basis to "get things done" can easily lead to opposite. It can cause mental fatigue, procrastination, and restlessness if not managed correctly.

###### **2) Digital Dementia**

This is the result of taking activities that would naturally help keep our brains sharp and outsourcing them to our digital devices. Over time this causes a level of dementia that is often overlooked because let's face it, when is the last time you had to remember a phone number or directions to get somewhere?

To some extent we all suffer from this. Its just a byproduct of the times we live in. I can even remember having this conversation with people 10+ years ago, bragging and saying "I don't save numbers in my phone to keep my memory sharp." That didn't last long lol.

###### **3) Digital Distraction**

Digital distraction leads to an overall lack of focus. The sensory overload that comes from these devices are a result of excessive external stimuli.

This hinders our ability to process information, as well as our ability to complete cognitive tasks.

If you're trying to get into the zone and do some deep work, our devices and the distractions that come with them are a touch away, ready to get us off track.

##### Some Solutions!

Why talk about a problem without discussing some solutions? Here are some things you can do (and not do) to fight off these digital monsters. Whether you apply these solutions or not, I will definitely suggest creating a "not to-do list".

1. DO NOT open your phone or PC the first hour of the day!! This is probably the most important thing you can do on a daily basis to overcome the digital battle. The easiest way to win the day is to start off by winning the 1st hour. If you jump online first thing in the morning you are training your brain to be reactive and not productive.  
      
    
2. Time Blocking - Use this method to help you focus on important tasks one at a time. You simply assign certain tasks to a specific time block of the day to work on UNINTERRUPTED. And don't convince yourself you can multitask. Countless studies show there is no such thing, at least when it comes to cognitive tasks.  
      
    
3. Do A Digital Detox - We all could use a break from being bombarded by our digital devices. Try to schedule a regular time frame when you fast from all the screen time. For example, I try to do one hour out of the day and one day out of the month. This gives our brains and our eyes time to recalibrate. Its also ideal to offset some of the screen time with time in nature.
