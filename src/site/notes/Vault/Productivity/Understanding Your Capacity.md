In order to hold more mass/volume, you must first increase [[capacity\|capacity]].

This simple principle lies at the heart of why some people reach extraordinary success, while others plateau and fall short. What if the universe doesn't withhold success, but rather our limited capacity to receive it does? What if expanding that capacity is the most important work we could ever undertake?

Many avoid this internal work, yet it may be the key that propels us to new heights, both physically and spiritually. The mere fact that we tend to separate physicality from spirit puts us in a constant state of lack and confusion. We often forget, regardless of the end expression, these are all conversations of light.

> The more the vessel is prepared, the more light it can hold.

-The Zohar*

Before continuing, let’s look at the definition of capacity.

It derives from the Latin word _capācitās_, which means "(cap)ability, understanding."

**Definitions**

- The maximum amount or number that can be contained or accommodated
- The ability to receive or contain
- The power of receiving impressions or knowledge
- The actual or potential ability to perform, yield, or withstand
- In geometry, the solid contents of a body

Based on these definitions, it's hard to comprehend why expanding our capacity isn’t atop of our priority list when looking to better ourselves and/or our career. So how do we begin to apply this knowledge to our lives?

---

We can start by finding out how capacity expresses itself in nature and/or science. I’m a firm believer that the answers to all inquiries can be found by examining the fundamentals of these two disciplines, then finding correspondence in our own lives. Some ways we can view capacity are:

- volume or storage capacity - how much volume or mass an object may hold
- temperature capacity - the amount of heat energy an object (or substance) can absorb before its temperature changes
- electrical capacity - an object or substance’s ability to hold electric charge
- mechanical or structural capacity - structural or mechanical capacity is an object’s ability to hold a certain load or withstand stress without failing
- information or data capacity - memory devices increase data capacity through optimization and layering.

Today we’re going to focus on what may be the simplest expression of capacity to understand: volume or storage capacity.

### Volume or Storage Capacity

**Correspondence -** The max blessings/burdens you are able to receive and process based on your “container”.

#### Implementation

This aspect of capacity immediately brings me to wealth and physical abundance. Many people want financial freedom but don’t even have the capacity for it. When it comes to money, or the ability to live without it, two prerequisites are essential: proper management and the right "vehicle".

**Management**  
One of my favorite stories from the Bible about the Kingdom is The Parable of the Talents (Matthew 25:14-30), especially verse 15, which reads as follows:

“And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability.”

The parable provides literal examples of spiritual principles that are inherent in our physical experience and it speaks directly to this discussion on capacity. In short, three servants were left with their own respective amount of their master’s (the Kingdom of Heaven) goods, based on their individual abilities.

The servant that was given 5 brought back 5 more in return, the servant that was given 2 brought back 2 more in return, but the servant who was given 1 buried it in the ground based on fear and gained none. When the master heard of this he referred to the unfruitful servant as wicked and slothful, took his money back, and threw him out.

The profitable servants on the other hand were promised they would be made “thee ruler over many things.”

**Key Takeaways:**

- God blesses us to the extent that we can receive the blessing
- Sound management over what you have already prepares you to manage more in the future
- We are expected to be good stewards, regardless of the cards we were dealt
- Fear is wicked, neglect is slothful; they both lead to ruin
- You can’t save your way to freedom

In order to increase our ability to receive we must first recognize that with greater abundance comes greater responsibility. The next step is to start “responding” to life’s experiences as if you have already received the abundance that awaits you. In other words, if you want to be wealthy, start managing your personal (and business) expenses like the wealthy do.

A quick, frictionless method to immediately expand your ability to receive financially is implementing a personal balance sheet.

Yea, sorry if that wasn’t the exhilarating solution you were looking for, but it is likely the optimal-minimal (a balance between easiest to implement and most impactful) one, especially if budgeting is an issue for you. It puts all of your financial decisions, good or bad, right in your face. Typically anyone who does this for the 1st time is shocked at how much money they’re throwing away on miscellaneous purchases.

On top of creating an improved financial awareness, the balance sheet will:

- help identify things like surplus cash and bad debt that lead to exploring investments and arbitrage opportunities
- simplifies your finances in an easy to read snapshot
- provide increased control and financial empowerment
- improve self-control and decision making

Remember, “**what we track improves, what we neglect decays**.”

**Vehicle**  
Along with increasing our management abilities, we must be sure that we are in a vehicle that can facilitate the results we want. You are probably not going to become financially free in a position that directly ties your time to how much money you can make. While your hourly/yearly pay can be vital along the path, in the long-term it is a trap that will have you exchanging your time for money perpetually. Wealth comes from producing value with your creativity, not exchanging your physical labor and time (both limited resources) for money.

We need to be in a vehicle that has the capacity to propel our goals and intentions. Once we can visualize clearly the future we want for ourselves, finding a fitting vehicle should be the next step. Note, if you already have a business (and have separated your time from money) you are excited about then your issue likely isn't the vehicle. There may be other levers you need to pull.

I won’t go into the lengthy conversation of how to choose your vehicle this go round. With that said, you definitely want to consider a vehicle that is a combination of: what you are great at, what you have a passion for, and what can provide you the lifestyle you desire.

Based on my personal experience, the vehicles that are best aligned with my future self are:

- **small business (through AI + collaboration)**
- **crypto**
- **real estate**

These are all proven wealth vehicles where I have strong networks, some experience, and enjoy participating in. They also have a low-barrier of entry, specifically through collaboration if you have a solid network. Some quick examples of how I’ve been able to get my hands dirty are:

- **Small Business** - taking AI serious from the outset and even taking a few courses put me in position to provide services for people in my network, one being managing the media on a growing YouTube page (accompanied w/ AI).
- **Crypto** - my network has allowed me to attend crypto conferences, speak at schools, and collaborate with other crypto “influencers” to host webinars/workshops.
- **Real Estate** - living in a thriving Georgia real estate market, a few of my peers have turned real estate agents and investors. I’ve been able to take advantage of this by helping facilitate 2 wholesale deals over the past couple years.

While these activities haven’t produced any home runs yet, they have put me in a great position to take advantage of any opportunity that may come my way. It also makes it that much easier to pick a business model of my own.

With a combination of increasing your management skills and choosing the right vehicle(s), you will immediately see changes in what you thought was possible. The first challenge is just believing it's possible. Tracking your trajectory with a balance sheet and choosing the right vehicle will begin to light the path and expand your capacity.

> Abundance, material as well as spiritual, is a structural expression of _rita,_ cosmic law or natural righteousness. There is no parsimony in the Divine, nor in Its goddess of phenomena, exuberant Nature.

-Paramahansa Yogananda
